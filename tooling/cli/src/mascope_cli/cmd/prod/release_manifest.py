"""
Release manifest generation and loading.

A release manifest is a small JSON document published alongside a release's
container images. It records the Alembic head baked into that release, so the
update preflight (and, later, an automated updater) can tell whether moving to
the release will run a database migration - the downtime-bearing case - without
having to spawn a throwaway container to read the head out of the image.

The manifest is deliberately minimal and forward-compatible: consumers check
``schema_version`` and read the fields they understand. Generation reads the
Alembic script directory only (no database, no Docker), so it runs in CI at
build time where the checkout is the source of truth for the head.
