# Changelog

Notable changes to Mascope are documented here. Versions follow the date-based scheme `YYYY.MM.DD-<hash>` produced by the release workflow, and releases are pinned with a semantic version tag `vX.Y.Z`.

## [Unreleased]

## 2026.07.02

### Added

- Version-pinned releases: a deployment can pin `MASCOPE_VERSION` to a release, and the web UI reports the running version.
- Citation metadata (`CITATION.cff`) and a software DOI for archived releases.
- Community health documents: contributing guide, code of conduct, and security policy.
- SDK example notebooks `06-08`, SDK version `2026.7.2`.

### Changed

- Rewrote the hosting documentation into a step-by-step production deploy and update guide.
- Removed the redundant release compose stack; local trials now use the demo stack.
- Updated backend dependencies, including a `python-socketio` security update.

### Fixed

- Corrected the demo quickstart download URL after the `develop` branch was retired.
- Fixed default values in the instrument parameter test.
- Fixed the Ubuntu installation script `tooling/ubuntu.sh` to work on Ubuntu >= 26.
- Run tests on PR to `master`, make workflow permissions read-only explicitly.
