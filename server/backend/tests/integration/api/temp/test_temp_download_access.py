"""Tests: per-user scoping of the temp download route ``GET /api/temp/{name}``.

A user may download only files in their own temp directory - never another
user's, even by exact filename - and path traversal is rejected. Regression
cover for the pre-hardening state where any authenticated user could fetch any
temp file by name (cross-tenant export leak).
